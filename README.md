This project simulates the bacterial growth inside a petri dish, where the user has controls over the time interval, the probability of mutation, and cell lifespan variables. Users can also add and remove live cells from the petri dish. The project also maps the current live, dead and total cells in the petri dish each generation in the file. The project runs as a regular typescript react app does, with the app.tsx file deploying everything, and many of the functionalities of the app being compartmentalized into separate initialization files inside the components directory. Key components include the initialization of the petri dish inside PetriDish.tsx, the ControlPanel and legend files try and reduce the load of app.tsx, and the GrowthChart.tsx file contains the initialization of the bonus component of the growth chart. The only assumption made in the project was the fact that users who wanted to manually add or remove cells would want to only add live cells. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
